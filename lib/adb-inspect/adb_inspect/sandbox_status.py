"""Surface inspect's silent docker provisioning as `status` events.

Running under ``display="none"`` (which the JSONL event channel requires) makes
inspect pass ``--progress quiet`` to every docker compose command and capture the
output of the long ones, so a first run can sit minutes inside a multi-GB image
pull with nothing on the stream — while the one thing compose still prints is a
harmless "No services to build" warning on stderr. Every such subprocess is,
however, wrapped in inspect's ``trace_action(logger, "Subprocess", cmd)``, which
logs structured records (``action``/``detail``/``event``/``duration`` as record
attributes — no message parsing) at TRACE level. This handler listens on the
``inspect_ai`` package logger (it sets ``propagate=False``, so a root handler
would never see these) and re-emits just the provisioning commands — docker
build/pull, plain or compose — as status events with durations. Per-tool-call
``compose exec`` and ``compose up``/``down`` chatter is deliberately excluded:
they fire per sample and the stream is already narrated at that level.
