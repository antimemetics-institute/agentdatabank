"""The inspect bridge is a TENANT layer over the canonical provider registry
(the adb-providers package): exceptions-only (identity is the default), referencing
canonical names and env vars, never inventing them. This check keeps the remap from
drifting away from the registry — a key that isn't canonical, or a bridged env var
the registry never declares, is a bug here, not a registry change. The TOML is read
by path: a tenant check doesn't warrant a package dependency."""
