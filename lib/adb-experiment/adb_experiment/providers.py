"""Provider prefixes -> OpenAI-compatible endpoints, resolved from the environment.

A model id's provider prefix (``anthropic/claude-…``, ``groq/llama-…``) picks which
credential set to read and which endpoint to talk to; every provider here serves the
OpenAI **/chat/completions** wire protocol, either natively or through a compatibility
mount. Each mapping is declared in ``PROVIDERS`` — explicit per provider, never
inferred from the id's shape. The runner injects the env vars from its credential
store (``adb-runner credentials``); this module only reads them.

No third-party deps. Every canonical provider (the adb-providers package's
registry) is routed: env var names, defaults, and requiredness are consumed
directly, restated nowhere. A provider belongs in the registry only if its
endpoint takes a plain bearer key over HTTP — OAuth-only surfaces (Vertex) have
no entry; degraded-but-correct beats a mapping that half-works. Should a
registry provider ever NOT speak the OpenAI protocol, this client grows an
exclusion — its concern, not the registry's.
