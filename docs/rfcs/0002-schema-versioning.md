# RFC 0002: Schema versioning

## 0. Envelope

Every record carries `v: int` (envelope shape, 0), `ts` (aware UTC
capture datetime), `run: str` (execution identifier), `experiment: str` (payload
schema family), `schema: NonNegativeInt` (that experiment's payload union
version), `seq: NonNegativeInt` (runner-assigned capture order), and `event`
(the validated payload). `(run, seq)` identifies a record; sequence alone does
not prove causal order across processes. `ts` always has six fractional digits
and a trailing Z; naive input is rejected.
`LLMCall.completed` uses the same UTC type and serializer. Python spells the
schema attribute `schema_`; JSON uses `schema`.

## 1. Envelope and payload versions

`v` versions only the envelope shape. An experiment's integer `schema` identifies
its full payload union, including shared vocabulary and its custom events. The
manifest declares `schema = { version, models }`, where `models` is a
`module:attribute` pointer; GovSim uses version 0 and
`govsim_adapter.models:Payload`. The runner stamps experiment and version on
every record. The manifest file's own `schema_version` is a third, independent
version, 1 for ordered, named result declarations. Readers select the appropriate union without rewriting saved records.

## 2. Compatibility and bumps

A schema version bumps only when records already written would fail to
deserialize under the new module. Adding optional fields, union members, or
literal values never bumps the version. Additive changes go in the current
schema module; readers use its latest compatible library. The same compatibility
rule applies to `v` for envelope changes. Incompatible changes
require a new schema module and an experiment schema-version bump, retaining the
old module for old records. Adding a raw harness record event alone therefore
neither creates GovSim schema 1 nor changes existing GovSim run bytes.

## 3. Frozen-module guard

Frozen schema modules are never edited. The guard in
[test_frozen.py](../../lib/adb-events/tests/test_frozen.py) compares SHA256 hashes
of `inspect_chat.py` and `models/llm.py` with
[frozen.json](../../lib/adb-events/tests/frozen.json), including comments and
provenance. Do not refresh those hashes to admit edits to published snapshots.
The current schema module is the extensible entry point: compatible declarations
and union additions there compose around unchanged frozen models. This permits
additive evolution without changing snapshots or bumping the schema version.
