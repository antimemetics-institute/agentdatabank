# RFC 0001: Event basics and model API instrumentation

ADB records strict Pydantic payloads in a runner-owned JSONL stream. Experiments
define their own typed custom observations alongside a small shared technical
vocabulary. Analysis requires Pydantic, with no Inspect or OpenTelemetry runtime.

## 0. Shared v0 vocabulary

The shared wire tags are exactly these ten:

| Tag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `run.start` | The runner begins launching an execution and snapshots provenance and inputs. |
| `run.end` | Terminal process state, duration and exit code. |
| `llm.call` | One observed model API operation, its effective request and available outcome. |
| `custom` | An experiment-defined observation discriminated by its namespaced `kind`. |
| `result` | One scalar result declared by the experiment's manifest. |
| `status` | the producer's current human-readable progress phrase; latest wins; structured progress belongs in custom events. |
| `log` | A deliberate diagnostic with `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error` severity. |
| `stdout` | A captured stdout line, including text that happens to be JSON. |
| `stderr` | A captured stderr line; stderr alone does not establish failure. |
| `producer.python` | The producer's own toolchain, once, first: implementation, version, executable, platform, libc, locale, hash seed, flags. Per-language tags `producer.<language>` are owned by that language's events library. |

Only the runner emits lifecycle records. Producers submit validated payloads
through `adb_events.emit` or `adb-emit`. A valid partial transcript may lack
`run.end`; absence alone establishes neither success nor continued execution.
The [events reference](../book/src/reference/events.md) specifies the fields.

`condition` is the single deliberate derived value in the stream, a hash of
experiment, source and params on the same record, kept because it is the identity
readers use to locate and pool runs; it is not precedent for other derived values.

## 1. Model calls

`LLMCall` carries `model`, `input`, `tools`, `tool_choice`, `output`, `call`,
`error`, `completed`, `working_time`, `metadata`, and ADB's `agent` attribution.
Chat, content, citation, tool, output and usage models come from Inspect AI
0.3.263, vendored in [inspect_chat.py](../../lib/adb-events/adb_events/inspect_chat.py).

**Boundary rule.** `llm.call` holds what crossed the model API, plus ADB timing
and agent attribution. Harness-only facts are recorded raw by that harness's
adapter. Fields earn a place as normalized projections (`tools`, `tool_choice`)
or facts not derivable from raw payloads (`agent`). Read generation settings
from `call.request`. Messages and calls are expanded.

`agent` is the backend's supplied attribution; Inspect uses the model role when
set, otherwise caller attribution, never per-sample scope. Each Inspect event
is recorded raw, immediately followed by `llm.call` for model events, including
cached events. `ToolCall.parse_error` preserves parsing evidence;
`ToolCallError.type` accepts API or harness error types.

**Metadata rule.** Notes use producer-prefixed keys. Shared readers depend on no
key; a key wanted by two producers becomes a field. The viewer does not read metadata.

Capture preserves all available choices, tools, multimodal content, detailed
usage and provider metadata. `call.request` and `call.response` are serialized
SDK objects, not HTTP bytes. Tool requests do not establish execution.
`input_tokens` excludes cached tokens; add cache read/write counts for total
input usage. Missing usage is unknown.

Failed requests retain available input and error. Internal SDK retries count
separately only if observed individually. Completion-time capture cannot preserve
an operation whose process dies awaiting a response. ChatClient records the
original response before stripping think blocks from returned text; a changed
return sets `metadata["adb_experiment.returned_text_stripped"] = true`.

## 2. Results

`Result` has `type="result"`, `name: str`, and `value: Scalar`: a finite number,
string or boolean. Its name refers to a manifest result declaration, which owns
the description and units. Series positions belong in custom observations,
such as `govsim.state.resource`, rather than in results.

The runner retains every result event and validates names against the manifest.
An undeclared name or repeated declared name produces a warning log. Consumers
derive the summary from the last result event per declared name, excluding
undeclared names and leaving missing results absent. Consumers also derive call
counts and usage from `llm.call` records alone. `run.end` contains only process
facts: `state`, `duration_s`, and `exit_code`; it carries no derived summary or
usage totals.

## 3. Stream and experiment schemas

The envelope, timestamps, compatibility and frozen-module rules are specified
in [RFC 0002](0002-schema-versioning.md); identity is specified in
[RFC 0004](0004-identity-provenance-and-pooling.md).
Optional model values are omitted with `exclude_none=True`; explicit nulls in
open JSON objects retain their meaning. Emission validates the exact serialized
payload it writes.

`CustomEvent` has `type="custom"`, `kind`, and JSON object `data`. Experiments
specialize it with strict data models and literal kinds, exporting a full
`Payload` union discriminated first on `type`, then on custom `kind`.
[GovSim schema 0](../../experiments/govsim/govsim_adapter/models.py) is the first
such union. `read_events(run_dir, payload=Payload)` accepts that type or its
Pydantic `TypeAdapter`; the default shared union reads custom data generically.
Invalid or truncated records raise an error identifying the file and line.

## 4. Deferrals

A tag is shared when the runner or verifier acts on it; promoting a custom kind
is a read-time projection declared in adb-events, never a rewrite;
cross-experiment views over raw kinds are projections, not tags.

Deferred names are `instance`, `artifact`, `agent.event`, `tool.call`,
`span.begin`, `span.end`, `limit`, and raw harness records.
Scientific concepts, including experiment-specific agent actions, remain typed
custom events. Deferred concepts do not add tags to this v0 vocabulary.
