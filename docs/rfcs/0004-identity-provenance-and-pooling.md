# RFC 0004: Identity, provenance and pooling

A condition groups runs of the same experiment with the same declared source
content and bound params. Source identity covers the experiment's declared
files and imported shared libraries; each run records the realized execution
environment separately. Release and behavior labels identify commits and make
claims about behavior without changing record identity, pooling keys or
[schema compatibility](0002-schema-versioning.md).

## 0. Declared content is identity

`source` fingerprints the experiment's declared source paths: `package.nix`,
`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, patches and adapter code, plus the shared Python
library source directories its program imports. `mkExperiment.sharedSrcs`
defaults to `lib/adb-events/adb_events` and
`lib/adb-experiment/adb_experiment`; Inspect programs also include
`lib/adb-inspect/adb_inspect`. `cleanImport` excludes development artifacts, and
surrounding tests, READMEs and tooling stay outside the library source paths.
`nixpkgs`, `uv2nix`, the runner's own closure, tests, READMEs, web, docs and
unrelated scripts are outside identity. A GovSim adapter comment changes GovSim's
fingerprint without changing Concordia's; an `adb_events/emit.py` change affects
both. The experiment's dependency versions in `uv.lock` and explicit interpreter
selection in `package.nix` are declared source, not implicit build environment.

If a glibc CVE re-fingerprinted every experiment, conditions would re-split every
few weeks and stop being a usable pooling unit. Excluding the platform toolchain
is a pooling decision, not a claim that it cannot affect behavior.
`uv.lock` is hashed without `[package.metadata.requires-dev]` tables: repeated
path-dependency dev metadata is outside identity, so shared test dependency
changes do not split experiment conditions. The exact
realized experiment closure is recorded per run in
`run.start.runtime.experiment_bin` ([§3](#3-execution-snapshot)), copied to
`provenance.runtime.experiment_bin` on the card; nothing is lost from the
closure's recorded identity. Reproducing that closure still requires retaining
its inputs or store objects. Runs can be compared by closure without assigning
them new conditions. This fingerprint identifies declared content, not all
external influences on an execution. The
[identity note](../book/src/running/model.md) describes its use when comparing
runs.

## 1. The interpreter rule

Every Python experiment declares its own interpreter in `package.nix`.
`mkPythonEnv` has no default for `python`: omitting it fails the build. A Python
experiment passes its chosen interpreter explicitly;
the declaration selects its interpreter and, because `package.nix` is an
identity path, records that choice in its source identity. The declaration and
the exact realized closure are distinct: a maintenance update to the selected
interpreter can change the closure while the declaration stays the same.

The platform cannot own this choice. `mkExperiment.program` is language-agnostic:
any program that speaks the runner protocol can be an experiment. A generic
`experiment_python_version` field would be meaningless for a non-Python
experiment. The experiment owns its toolchain.

## 2. Fetch reference and tree hash

`fetch_ref: str | None` identifies a pinned clean repository revision from which
the packaging source can be fetched. A dirty tree has no `fetch_ref`; neither
does a launch with no known pinned clean revision. None is omitted on the wire.
The launcher rejects userinfo before exporting a reference. A source fingerprint
or packaging hash cannot stand in for a fetchable revision, and a saved reference
does not by itself guarantee continued availability of the revision.

`tree_hash: str | None` is the packaging tree's NAR hash. The launcher emits it
whenever known, for clean and dirty trees alike. It identifies that packaging
tree independently of the narrower experiment `source` fingerprint and does
not participate in condition identity. It is evidence of content, not a storage
location: recovering a dirty tree still requires preserving its bytes.
`tree_hash` is recorded only where the launcher can compute it, such as flake
builds; its absence carries no meaning.

Sweeps refuse to launch from a dirty tree. Publishing refuses a card with no
`fetch_ref`: a run with no commit belongs to no release, ever. Local exploratory
runs remain possible, but the absence of a pinned revision cannot be repaired
by assigning a release label afterward.

## 3. Execution snapshot

`run.start` carries launch facts and `run.end` carries terminal process facts;
neither contains aggregates of other records. The stream is the truth, the card
is a cache of it, and nothing reads the card as an input. Each launcher invocation
executes one run. Runs record the `--seed` argument unchanged, or a random
non-negative 31-bit seed when omitted. The sections of the
runner's index card, local storage and published layout are defined in
[RFC 0003](0003-run-directory-and-published-layout.md). Runtime closure paths can
differ between the flake and classic doors on a checkout with untracked files
while `source` does not: `source` is identity, and closure paths are covariates.

The runner pins both `LANG` and `LC_ALL` to `C.UTF-8` in the child environment,
rather than inheriting the launching shell's locale. It records the CPU model
and core count in `run.start.runtime`, which the card copies into its provenance
section. These are execution covariates, never identity.
The producer's own toolchain is recorded in `producer.python`.

## 4. Condition as pooling key

`condition = hex(sha256(JCS({experiment, source, params})))[:40]` is the pooling key for
runs with the same declared experiment, fingerprint and bound input values.
This is 160 bits, matching the Nix store's hash width, encoded as 40 lowercase
hexadecimal characters. `canonical.condition_id` is the single implementation;
records and paths use its result unchanged. Condition storage names append
`-<experiment>`; readers derive those names from the recorded fields and never
parse the suffix. Each execution has its own run identifier,
`yyyymmddthhmmssz-<12 lowercase hex random>`, using the launching machine's UTC
clock and six random bytes. The whole string is the ID; its date is a launch-time
label, not evidence. Seeds, credential
profiles, endpoints, runner/platform details, fetch references and packaging
tree hashes are outside this key. Pooling establishes matching declared inputs;
it does not assert equivalent provider behavior or scientific comparability.

## 5. Toolchain bumps and the claim they make

`nixpkgs` stable and `uv2nix` are bumped together at each six-month stable
release. Security patches within a stable release are taken as they land.
A platform toolchain bump asserts that experiment behavior is unchanged. That
is a falsifiable, withdrawable claim, not a proof. Replicates straddling a bump
share a `condition_id` and differ in `experiment_bin`; the recorded closure
provides the distinction researchers use to test the claim.
The claim is tested against the producer's interpreter, libc and locale recorded
in `producer.python`.

Re-locking `uv.lock` is not a platform toolchain bump. It changes declared
experiment content and is expected to change identity. Changing an explicit
interpreter declaration likewise changes source identity. Neither change is
hidden behind the behavior-preservation claim for excluded build inputs.

The same withdrawable claim applies to any commit labelled behavior-preserving.

## 6. Releases and version labels

A release names a commit. Its membership is the published runs whose `fetch_ref`
points to that commit, without an enumerated membership list. Release labels are
applied after the fact and exist to select a version to run. They are never
written into records and never change a run's fingerprint, condition or schema.
Pooling follows condition identity (experiment, fingerprint and bound params),
never a release label or version number.

An experiment behavior version, such as `0.1.1`, is independent of schema
compatibility. A behavior change can change the source fingerprint while using
the same schema, and a compatible schema addition does not prescribe a behavior
release. Behavior labels are never coupled to schema integers. Versions are
chronological and never renumbered. A behavior break is recorded against the
fingerprints it separates in an explicit catalog field, without rewriting the
identity of existing runs.

Claims are withdrawn in place. Git history is the erratum: it preserves the
original claim and the correction. Withdrawing a claim neither rewrites run
records nor retrospectively changes their fingerprints.
