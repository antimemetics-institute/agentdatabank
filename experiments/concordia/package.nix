# Concordia (google-deepmind's generative agent-based modeling library) as an ADB
# experiment: multi-agent social simulations, translated live into ADB events.
#
# ONE experiment: Concordia scenarios are data interpreted by one program, so the
# scenario — the cast of `agents`, the `premise`, the `game_master` — is composed in
# params (the webui renders the roster as an editable table), not baked into cards.
# Cards mark code boundaries (inspect tasks are different programs); params mark data.
# Named canonical scenarios ("the cafe scene") are the planned user-space template
# concept — docs/plan/templates.md — which groups runs by content-matching realized
# params, so runs recorded today collate under templates created later.
#
# Every configuration runs keyless on `mock/model` (deterministic scripted lines, no
# network), against any OpenAI-compatible /chat/completions server via
# `openai/<served-name>`, or against a hosted provider's OpenAI-compatibility
# endpoint (`anthropic/`, `google/`, `groq/`, `mistral/`, `grok/`, `openrouter/`,
# `azureai/`, `bedrock/` — see concordia_sim/providers.py) — endpoint and key come
# from the credential store, never from params.
