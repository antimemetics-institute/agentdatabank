"""The language model behind every agent and the game master.

One class implementing Concordia's `LanguageModel` interface (`sample_text` /
`sample_choice`) by delegating to Concordia's own ``BaseGPTModel``
(concordia.contrib), which owns all prompt-shaping (the continuation system message
+ few-shot examples) and the multiple-choice retry loop. Underneath it sits
:class:`adb_events.llm.ChatClient` — the ADB-instrumented OpenAI-compat client:
provider routing from the model id's prefix, one ``llm.call`` event per call with
usage and latency, reasoning-tag stripping, and the keyless ``mock/`` backend.

The mock rides the same BaseGPTModel path as real models — only the responder is
swapped (deterministic scripted lines; exact-option answers for choice prompts; a
valid action spec when the game master asks for one), so the smoke/CI run
exercises upstream's prompt assembly too.

Every call — mock or real — emits one ``llm.call`` event, so the event stream has
the same shape keyless as it does against a real model.
