"""The config->structure boundary: the params a single Concordia run accepts.

A pydantic model so a malformed config is rejected cleanly (before the heavy Concordia
import), with `extra="forbid"` so a typo'd key is an error, not a silently-ignored knob.

This is the sim program's FULL config surface — roster, premise, game master, and the
run knobs. The experiment cards in package.nix bake the scenario fields (agents,
premise, game_master) per experiment and expose only the comparison axes (models,
steps, generation knobs) as params: the scenario is the experiment, never a param.
The defaults here exist so a standalone/test invocation has a sensible scenario;
they never reach a real run, whose adapter always writes a complete config.
`seed` is not authored by a caller — the adapter merges `$ADB_SEED` in.
