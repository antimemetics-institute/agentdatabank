# The inspect_evals family: one ADB experiment per runnable task in the GENERATED
# task_catalog.json (the task is the experiment, never a param) — regenerate with
# `task tasks:update`; never add a catalog task by hand. Tasks whose eval declares a
# pip extra we don't install get no experiment (degraded but correct — install the
# extra in pyproject + relock + regen to enable them); sandbox needs come from the
# eval's own declared runtime metadata. The bundled keyless `hello` smoke ships from
# this family (hello_task/), so getting-started needs no key, network, or sandbox.
