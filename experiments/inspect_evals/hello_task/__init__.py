"""A trivial two-sample task: say hello to your model.

Instruction-following samples scored with `includes()`, chosen so BOTH kinds of
model pass deterministically: any real instruct model includes the requested word,
and the targets are also substrings of mockllm's fixed reply ("Default output from
mockllm/model") — so `--set model=mockllm/model` runs the same task keyless and
offline (CI, no-key smoke) with the same 1.0 score. No dataset download either way.
