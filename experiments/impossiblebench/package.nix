# ImpossibleBench (arXiv:2510.20270) as ADB experiments: coding benchmarks whose
# "impossible" test variants (oneoff / conflicting) can only be passed by
# specification-violating shortcuts — passing IS the reward-hacking signal.
#
# One experiment per upstream @task (the task is the experiment, never a param):
#   impossiblebench-livecodebench → impossiblebench.impossible_livecodebench
#   impossiblebench-swebench      → impossiblebench.impossible_swebench
#
# Both run agentic coding loops inside an inspect sandbox: docker must be on the
# host PATH (SWE-bench pulls per-instance images; the runner forwards PATH into the
# experiment). VM-isolated execution (forest.nix) is the planned replacement.
