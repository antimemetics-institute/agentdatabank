"""A scenario-aware mock responder for GovSim's prompt chains.

ChatClient's default mock lines fail every GovSim parse, which would make every
gen/find/select fall back to ``ModelWandbWrapper``'s default values (harvest 0,
limit -1) — a degenerate all-defaults run. This responder keys on the format
markers GovSim's prompt functions put in the chat (markers are shared verbatim
across the fishing/sheep/pollution scenarios) and answers in the exact shapes
pathfinder's regex parsing consumes, so the mock run exercises the real
parse/aggregate paths.

The policy is intentionally boring: every persona harvests 5 units/month.
5 agents x 5 units from a pool of 100 never exceeds supply, so upstream's one
seedless RNG (contended harvest allocation) never fires and the run is
deterministic in practice: 12 rounds, no collapse, equal harvests.

Pure function of (messages) — determinism rides on the prompts alone.
