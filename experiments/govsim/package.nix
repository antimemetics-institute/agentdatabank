# GovSim ("Cooperate or Collapse", Piatti et al., NeurIPS 2024) as an ADB
# experiment: 5 LLM personas share a common-pool resource — harvest, negotiate,
# collapse or sustain.
#
# Upstream is pinned with one seed-forwarding patch: the checkout rides PYTHONPATH (GovSim
# ships no pyproject, so it cannot be a uv dependency); its pathfinder DSL is a
# proper uv git dependency (pinned in pyproject.toml). Other adaptation lives in
# ./govsim_adapter: config composition (hydra compose over the upstream conf tree), model
# injection (a ChatClient-backed pathfinder ModelAPI), embedder substitution
# (deterministic hash embedder on the keyless path), wandb neutralization, and
# metric extraction from the persisted log_env.json.
