# Typing-suppression policy for the python packages (runs first in `task typecheck`;
# pyright strict enforces everything type-shaped, this enforces what pyright can't
# express — WHICH escapes are allowed):
#
#   * `# type: ignore` in any form is banned (it's also inert: pyrightconfig sets
#     enableTypeIgnoreComments=false, so it would be a dead comment anyway).
#   * `# pyright:` file directives are banned except rule-scoped ignores — no bare
#     `# pyright: ignore`, no per-file mode downgrades (`# pyright: basic`, or
#     rule=false toggles). A file cannot opt out of strict.
#   * rule-scoped ignores are ALLOWLISTED below: each rule earned its place by one
#     of the two sanctioned reasons — runtime validation stronger than the static
#     contract, or a named third-party typing gap. Adding a rule here is a policy
#     change; make it in this file, in a reviewed diff, with the reason.
#   * `cast()` is allowlisted BY FILE: it is only sanctioned at declared dynamic
#     third-party boundaries. A new cast anywhere else fails here — either give the
#     value a real type, or argue the file into the list.
