"""The runner protocol: spawn the experiment, feed params, envelope + persist events.

runner → experiment: params JSON on stdin; ADB_RUN_ID/ADB_RUN_DIR/ADB_SEED env;
fresh workspace as cwd; a small env allowlist (never the full host environment).
experiment → runner: validated JSON events through ADB_EVENT_SOCKET; stdout and
stderr are always captured as text. The runner records typed envelopes and
acknowledges each socket submission after writing it to the event store.
